## 📊 Dataset
**Adult Income Dataset**

The dataset contains demographic and employment-related attributes such as age, education, occupation, workclass, capital gain, hours per week, and income level.

## 🔍 Task Steps Performed

1. Identified categorical and numerical features.
2. Applied Label Encoding to ordered/binary categorical variables.
3. Applied One-Hot Encoding to nominal categorical variables.
4. Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
5. Compared dataset before and after scaling.
6. Saved the final preprocessed dataset.
